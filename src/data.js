        song: "Let It Go — Frozen OST",
        lyrics: `The sunlight shines on the leafy green,\nThe roots drink water from below unseen.\nCarbon dioxide fills the air,\nThe stomata breathe it in with care.\n\nThe chloroplasts begin their song,\nTurning light to food all day long.\nGlucose is made, oxygen’s free,\nA perfect plant factory!\n\nPhotosynthesis, photosynthesis,\nMaking food with air and light like this!\nPhotosynthesis, photosynthesis,\nIn every leaf — pure science bliss!\n\nI don’t care what they try to say,\nThis is how plants eat...\nWith sun and air — their natural way!`
